Recently I completed courses on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com) about [Helm](https://www.helm.sh) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). 
I learned a lot about Helm and Kubernetes. I can recommend it to everyone (The course is in German).

In this repo there are several sample Helm Charts and Kubernetes Manifests related to the courses
